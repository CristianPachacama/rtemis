\details{
Note on terminology for all models:
The training set is used to build a model. The testing set is a separate set never touched during
training and only used to a. create predictions using the trained model and b. estimate error metrics.
This reflects generalizability of the model and is the error we care the most about. It is saved in rtemis models
as \code{error.test}.
The validation set is used during model tuning. Within rtemis, validation sets are created and
used automatically by \link{resample} when appropriate, they are not generally input by the user
(with few exceptions).
